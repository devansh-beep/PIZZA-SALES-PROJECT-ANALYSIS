# PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSIS
## Project Objective
I Have Developed a Comprehensive Project On Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze data. This process involves several stages  including data processing, data cleaning and data visualization.
To better understand how our pizza business is performing, we need to look at some important numbers and create helpful visuals. Here’s what we plan to do:

First, we’ll calculate a few key metrics:
- How much money we’ve made in total from all pizza sales.
- On average, how much each customer spends when they place an order.
- The total number of pizzas we’ve sold.
- How many orders customers have placed overall.
- On average, how many pizzas are in each order.

Once we have those numbers, we’ll create a few charts to help us see patterns and trends:
- A daily chart showing how many orders we get each day. This will help us spot busy or slow days.
- A monthly chart to see what times of day are the busiest for orders.
- A pie chart showing how sales are split between different types of pizzas.
- Another pie chart to show which pizza sizes are most popular.
- A funnel chart to compare how many pizzas we sell in each category.
- A bar chart to highlight our top 5 best-selling pizzas—based on money earned, total sold, and number of orders.
- And finally, a bar chart showing the 5 pizzas that aren’t selling as well, so we can look into why they’re not performing.

## QUESTIONS ASKED (KPI's)

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.

2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.

4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.

5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

## CHARTS REQUIREMENT


We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

1. Daily Trend for Total Orders:
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.

2. Monthly Trend for Total Orders:
Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.

3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:
Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.

4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:
Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.

5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:
Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.

6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:
Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.

7. Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:
Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.
