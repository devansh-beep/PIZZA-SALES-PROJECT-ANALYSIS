# PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSIS
## Project Objective
I Have Developed a Comprehensive Project On Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze data. This process involves several stages  including data processing, data cleaning and data visualization.
To better understand how our pizza business is performing, we need to look at some important numbers and create helpful visuals. Here’s what we plan to do:

First, we’ll calculate a few key metrics:
- How much money we’ve made in total from all pizza sales.
- On average, how much each customer spends when they place an order.
- The total number of pizzas we’ve sold.
- How many orders customers have placed overall.
- On average, how many pizzas are in each order.

Once we have those numbers, we’ll create a few charts to help us see patterns and trends:
- A daily chart showing how many orders we get each day. This will help us spot busy or slow days.
- A monthly chart to see what times of day are the busiest for orders.
- A pie chart showing how sales are split between different types of pizzas.
- Another pie chart to show which pizza sizes are most popular.
- A funnel chart to compare how many pizzas we sell in each category.
- A bar chart to highlight our top 5 best-selling pizzas—based on money earned, total sold, and number of orders.
- And finally, a bar chart showing the 5 pizzas that aren’t selling as well, so we can look into why they’re not performing.

## QUESTIONS ASKED (KPI's)

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.

2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.

4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.

5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
